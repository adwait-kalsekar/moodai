# Mood AI

## The FastAPI and MongoDB service is at https://github.com/adwait-kalsekar/mood_fastapi_service

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind Mood AI stemmed from the desire to provide users with a creative outlet to express their emotions and activities in a unique and visually captivating way. We wanted to harness the power of AI technology to generate personalized digital art pieces that reflect the user's mood and interests.
Additionally, we envisioned incorporating social media features to allow users to share their creations with their social networks, fostering a sense of community and connection among users. These features would enable users to engage with and inspire each other, further enhancing the platform's appeal and user experience.

## What it does

Mood AI is a web application that allows users to input their current mood and desired activity. Using advanced AI algorithms, the platform generates digital art pieces that align with the user's input. Additionally, users can explore creations from other users, fostering a sense of community and inspiration just like social media.

## How we built it

We built Mood AI using a combination of frontend and backend technologies. For the frontend, we utilized HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. The backend was developed using Django, which handles server-side logic, data processing, and interaction with the database. MongoDB was chosen as the database management system, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing user data and image metadata. Authentication and authorization were implemented using Auth0 to ensure secure access to the platform's resources.

## Challenges we ran into

Throughout the development process, we encountered several challenges. We faced difficulties integrating certain APIs, such as Novita and Stable diffusion API, due to complicated access methods and limitations on API calls. Additionally, we encountered challenges with integrating MongoDB with Django and configuring certain features of the AI API, such as adjusting parameters to optimize image quality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges we faced, we're proud of the seamless integration of AI algorithms into the platform, allowing users to generate personalized digital art pieces based on their mood and activities. We're also proud of creating a vibrant and engaging community-driven platform where users can explore, interact, and find inspiration in each other's creations.

## What we learned

Throughout the development process, we learned valuable lessons about API integration, database management, and optimizing AI algorithms for generating digital art. We gained a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in building a web application that seamlessly integrates advanced technologies while ensuring security, scalability, and performance.

## What's next for Mood AI

In the future, we plan to continue enhancing Mood AI by implementing new features and functionalities based on user feedback. This may include expanding the range of AI-generated art styles, improving community interaction features, and further optimizing the platform's performance and scalability. Additionally, we aim to address any remaining challenges and limitations to provide users with an even more seamless and enriching experience.

In addition to the aforementioned plans, we aspire to make Mood AI more interactive, akin to a social media platform. Our vision includes integrating features that foster greater user engagement and connectivity, enabling users to interact with each other's content in meaningful ways.

One exciting addition to our roadmap is the integration of TinyMCE into our application. This integration will empower users to generate personalized digital art based on their personal diaries and life stories, creating a secure and private space for self-expression. By leveraging TinyMCE, users will have the ability to combine images, music, videos, and written content to create rich and immersive narratives.

Furthermore, we aim to facilitate connections among users who share similar emotions, enabling them to find solace and inspiration in each other's experiences. This communal aspect will serve as a source of encouragement and support, fostering a sense of belonging within the Mood AI community.
As we continue to evolve Mood AI, we remain committed to upholding regulations and guidelines to ensure a safe and positive environment for all users. By combining advanced AI technology with user-generated content, we strive to create a platform that empowers individuals to express themselves authentically and creatively.
